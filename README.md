posts and when any of the items is clicked show the list of comments that are associated with
that specific post.

## TO RUN PROJECT

## TECH STACK

React, Redux, React Hooks

## Assumptions and design decisions

1. As it was not specified, there is no need to add user email and username before adding a comment to a post, so...i used personal email and name to add a comment
2. Mobile was not requested, however, i tried to make it acceptable
3. All calls are handled via redux actions creators
